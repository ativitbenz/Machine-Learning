    "# Exploratory Data Analysis of Stock Options Flow Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in the data analysis process that involves the visual and statistical examination of data to identify patterns, relationships, and anomalies. It provides an understanding of the underlying structure of the data and allows for insights to be gathered and hypotheses to be formed before proceeding to more complex analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to the Project\n",
    "This project focuses on performing EDA on a stock options flow dataset to gain insights into the stock options market. The dataset contains information on the `trading volume`, `open interest`, and `pricing of various stock options contracts`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Contents\n",
    "1. Overview of the Stock Options Flow Dataset\n",
    "2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing\n",
    "3. Univariate Analysis\n",
    "4. Bivariate Analysis\n",
    "5. Multivariate Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Some Advanced Stuff\n",
    "1. Detailed Filtering\n",
    "2. Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction (***TODO***)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Main Idea\n",
    "The main idea of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis(EDA) on a stock options flow dataset to gain insights into the stock options market. The project covers various data analysis techniques, including univariate, bivariate, multivariate, and time series analysis, as well as advanced techniques such as clustering and dimensionality reduction (***TODO***)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "1. To gain hands-on experience in performing EDA on a real-world stock options flow dataset\n",
    "2. To understand the importance of data cleaning and preprocessing in the data analysis process\n",
    "3. To be able to apply various data analysis techniques, including univariate, bivariate, multivariate, and time series analysis\n",
    "4. To understand advanced techniques such as clustering and dimensionality reduction and their applications in stock options analysis\n",
    "5. To gain insights into the stock options market through the analysis of the stock options flow dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "## How it's Helpful\n",
    "This project is helpful in gaining a deeper understanding of the stock options market and the techniques used in data analysis. The project provides hands-on experience in performing exploratory data analysis, which is a valuable skill for anyone interested in data analysis, finance, or stock options. The insights gained through the analysis of the stock options flow dataset can be useful for investors and traders in making informed decisions in the stock options market.\n",
